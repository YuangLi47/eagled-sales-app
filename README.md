# Eagled Sales App

A light-weight Python desktop application for generating quotations and packing lists, built with Tkinter and pandas.

## Features

- GUI
- Automatic calculations
- Export to PDF
- Mac-ready packaging
- Limited Data Management Capabilities

## Future Improvements

This project was originally created as a self-learning exercise to explore **Tkinter** for the first time and to reduce manual errors in generating quotations and packing lists. Its primary goal is to improve document processing efficiency.

Please note:  
There may be known and undetected bugs within the current codebase due to its early-stage nature.

### Potential Future Updates:
- Refactor the codebase for better structure and maintainability  
- Replace Tkinter with a modern GUI library (e.g., PyQt or Electron) to enhance the user interface  
- Add user authentication for secure access  
- Integrate cloud-based data management  
- Improve user interaction features (e.g., notifications, input validation, form flow)
